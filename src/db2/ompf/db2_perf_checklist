Column1,Column2,Column3,Your value
Group,Metric,Target/Range,
Buffer Pool,Total read I/O rate (/sec),"Target per pool: <1000 (better <100, best <10)",
Buffer Pool,GETPAGE rate (/sec),"If >1000/sec, use 1MB/2GB large frames (if paging <1/sec)",
Buffer Pool,Prefetch disabled - no buffer,0,
Buffer Pool,Prefetch disabled - no read engine,0,
Buffer Pool,Async writes vs Sync writes (/sec),Async > Sync (unless total writes <10/sec),
Buffer Pool,DM threshold,0,
Group Buffer Pool,XI sync read hit ratio (%),>=90% (ideal >=95%) when XI reads >10/sec,
Group Buffer Pool,Write failed - no storage,0,
EDM (DBD cache),Fails due to DBD pool full,0,
EDM (SKEL cache),Fails due to skeleton pool full,0,
EDM,Hit ratio / Not found,Very high hits; not found ~0,
DSMAX,Closes due to DSMAX,0 or very low,
Dynamic Statement Cache,CACHE HIT RATIO (%),>=95% (ideal >99%),
Accounting,Aggregate SQL CPU by connection type,Use to find the largest consumer,
Accounting,"Not-accounted-for time (Class 2, %)",<10% for high-priority Tx; batch may be higher,
Accounting / zIIP,zIIP offload rate = SE/(CP+SE),55-60% very good (DDF),
Accounting / zIIP,zIIP spill-over rate,<1% great; >5% indicates shortage,
Accounting / I/O,Average synchronous read time,Modern very low; >1 ms is concerning,
Accounting / Threads,Thread reuse rate,Higher is better (~99%+),
